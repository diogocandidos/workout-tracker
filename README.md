An application that allows the user creates and tracks daily workouts. The user can log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. The user is able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track the distance traveled.

## Acceptance Criteria

When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

The user should be able to:

  * Add exercises to a previous workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises on the `stats` page.
